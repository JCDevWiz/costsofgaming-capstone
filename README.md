# The Real Costs of Gaming through the Years

## Summary

This capstone project examines the costs of console gaming through the years, accounting for inflation, and finding when gaming was at its peak for value and variety. I look to examine almost 50 years of data and provide insights to one of the largest growing media of our time.

## Motivation

I’ve always been a gamer since I was around 5 years old. I started on the NES classic which came out in 1985 before I got my N64 which came out in 1996. I find the gaming industry fascinating as it has become one of the top forms of media in the world. Much like the motion picture of the 1900’s, gaming is the 2000’s world wonder and a billion-dollar industry every year. I want to analyze the differences in time periods and what the costs were in each decade to find out when gaming was considered at its peak for value and profit. Or are we not there yet?

## Data Questions

What is the cost of gaming over the last 50 years? Adjusted for inflation is it cheaper or more expensive now than in the 80's when gaming rose to prominence?

The following questions were also looked at:

   - When was the peak of gaming so far? The most affordabile, most product, etc. 
   - What was the percentage of games created in different decades?
   - Against other media, which had the best/worst inflation?

## Data Tools
   - Excel - Data cleaning and manipulation
   - Python - Data cleaning, manipulation, filtering, analysis, and preliminary data visualization
   - Power BI - Interactive dashboard to present findings

## Issues and Challenges

Peripheral data and discount data are nonexistent. With fluctuations in discounts, it wasn't possible to find when the best time to buy product would have been. Peripherals come in various forms and was not considered for this analysis. 

Like modern day streaming taking over the movie industry and leaving physical media like DVD's in the background, gaming has had the same happen with "freemium" titles. As profit shifted from a physical console with a physical cartridge or disc to digital sales, we've seen a huge shift in software related changes. Free titles generate most of the industries profit through downloadable content and in-game purchases while mobile gaming has taken off among every generation for its ease of access. This led to many challenges surrounding finding information on platform specific sales and most of it is proprietary unless the company has previously mentioned their sales. 

I had to limit my time period up to 2016 for games as that is where the dataset ended while I did also did not include every off-market console as many countries create their own brands of the same system. 

## Conclusions

My analysis shows that while prices for consoles have gone up over the years, the price for inflation to own a console is going down. Relative to other media, it has also trended downward into a more valuable option to spend your time. Due to prices in computing power and hardware going down, this made sense. Where my analysis opened up into a multi-layered conclusion was around 2008 and beyond. Mobile phones were cheaper and more powerful than ever and started looking to take their market share of the gaming pie. Digital downloads became the norm as a $60 game could now sell hundreds of dollars of add-on's with in-game purchases. So my final thoughts are that, yes, it is now way cheaper than ever to game inside your home with a robust list of free-to-play titles and premium game purchases. The caveat lies within your own enjoyment of a game. Is it worth it to you to play the game for free or would you like a $15 battlepass to get a leg up on your opponents? What about that $20 Stranger Things skin for your character? Or that sweet 10% discount on the premium in-game currency when you buy $100 worth of it? Value and fun lie in the eye of the beholder.
